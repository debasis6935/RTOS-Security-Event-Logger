# RTOS Security Event Logger

## Overview
The **RTOS Security Event Logger** is a security monitoring tool designed for real-time operating system (RTOS) environments. It provides logging capabilities for security-related events such as authentication attempts, file access, and system performance, ensuring a robust security framework for embedded systems.

## Features
- **AI/ML Integration:** Uses machine learning techniques to enhance security event detection.
- **Authentication Logging:** Monitors and records authentication attempts.
- **File Access Monitoring:** Tracks and logs access to important files.
- **Graphical Visualization:** Generates visual representations of security events.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Ensures minimal impact on system performance while logging events.

## File Structure
- **`ai_ml_integration.py`** - Implements AI/ML-based security enhancements.
- **`auth_system.py`** - Manages authentication logging.
- **`file_access.py`** - Monitors file access activities.
- **`graph.py`** - Provides visualization for logged security events.
- **`main.py`** - Central execution module that manages logging and event handling.
- **`performance.py`** - Monitors the system's performance impact.
